Aim/Overview of the practical: 

1.Music players are very popular these days because music has become popular. This is why music players like Spotify, Wynk, 
and Gaana have become popular because they bring music closer to you. So, the objective of this project is to create a GUI
based python music player from scratch using python. For this project, you will need intermediate knowledge of the Tkinter
widgets, basic knowledge about tkinter.filedialog, pygame.mixer, and os libraries.

 Task to be done:
 
Here are the steps you will need to perform to build python music player project:
1. Importing all the libraries
2. Initializing the root window and pygame.mixer
3. Defining the play, stop, pause, resume and load functions
4. Creating the LabelFrames and StringVar variables
5. Placing all the objects in all the three LabelFrames
6. Creating the final Label that will display the status of the son


 Learning outcomes (What I have learnt):

 
1. Gain hands-on experience with creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) using 
Tkinter, including the layout of frames, buttons, labels, and list boxes.
2. Learn how to manage user interactions through buttons and how to update the GUI 
dynamically based on user actions.
3. Learn how to integrate audio playback functionality using the Pygame library, 
including loading, playing, pausing, and stopping audio tracks.
4. Understand how to manage audio states (playing, paused, stopped) and how to handle 
multiple tracks in a playlist.
5.Gain experience with file handling in Python, including using the filedialog module to 
allow users to select directories and load files dynamically.
6. Learn how to manipulate file paths and directories using the os module.
7. Understand the concept of event-driven programming, where the program responds to 
user inputs (e.g., button clicks) to trigger specific functions
